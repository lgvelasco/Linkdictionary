## Refactor Branch
Faster branch code was refactored using the following principles:
* Meaningful names
* Keep functions small
* Avoid redundant commenting
* Single responsibility principle
* Don’t repeat yourself
* Keep your code simple
* You ain’t gonna need it

### Examples
Although changes where made through the entirety of the code, here
are some examples:

The method _compareTwoFiles()_ was renamed to _compareIfTwoFilesAreTheSame()_
